Hello, I'm Cai Jiawen, 31 years old.

If you see someone on a football field wearing a sweat-soaked jersey, smiling and high-fiving teammates, that might be me. If you see someone in a café frowning thoughtfully at a computer screen filled with dense code and K-line charts, that might also be me.

This is who I am—a tech entrepreneur who has been working in the cryptocurrency and AI fields for several years, and also an ordinary husband, father, and sports enthusiast.

## What Have I Done?

### A Modern "Gold Prospector" in Crypto

Over the past few years, I've been like a modern gold prospector, except instead of mining gold, I've been mining opportunities in the digital currency market.

I've developed various quantitative trading programs: arbitrage bots that search for price differences between exchanges, acting like tireless arbitrage merchants; market-making bots that provide liquidity in markets, earning modest but stable spreads; trend trading programs that try to capture major market movements, like shrewd speculators.

Imagine when others were still manually buying and selling Bitcoin, my programs were already working 24/7, like sleepless traders. Sometimes waking up in the middle of the night to see profit notifications felt like finding money while sleeping.

I've also started businesses many times—some successful, some failed. I've built off-chain applications like trading tools and data analysis platforms, and on-chain applications like DeFi protocols and NFT projects. As Franklin said, "Failure is the mother of success," and each failure taught me something new.

## What Am I Doing Now?

### Crypto: Being a "Missionary" for Digital Currency

The timing now is interesting. Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, which is like Wall Street officially extending an olive branch to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's market cap has also grown large enough that even conservative investment institutions can't ignore it.

This reminds me of when the internet was just becoming popular. Back then, many people didn't know what email was, and now almost everyone uses WeChat. I think cryptocurrency is at this turning point.

So my main work now is like being a "digital currency missionary"—helping people who don't understand blockchain to understand this world, letting them own their own crypto wallets and digital assets.

Not encouraging them to speculate and trade coins, but teaching them how to safely manage digital assets and how to steadily grow these assets. Like teaching people financial management, just with blockchain as the tool.

### AI: Being a "Magician" of Productivity

In terms of AI, I'm like a modern magician, using various AI tools to cast "productivity magic."

For example, I now use Claude Code to write code, which is 3 times more efficient than before. Programs that used to take me a day to write can now be completed in a few hours. I use AI to analyze market data, which can process information in minutes that used to take me hours to analyze.

My goal is to automate more repetitive work, allowing humans to focus on more creative things. Just as the Industrial Revolution freed people from heavy physical labor, the AI revolution should free people from heavy mental labor.

## What's My Life Like?

### An Ordinary "Family of Three + One Dog"

Outside of work, I live a very ordinary life.

I have a son who's almost 7 years old, at the age where he asks "Dad, why is the sky blue?" every day. I also have a dog that wakes me up on time every morning, more reliable than any alarm clock.

My wife often jokes that I spend my days at the computer researching those "invisible and intangible" digital currencies, but at night I have to tell bedtime stories to my son and walk the dog to pick up after it. This is the real portrait of a modern tech worker—half in the clouds, half on the ground.

### An "All-Around" Sports Enthusiast

If work keeps my brain active, then sports are the secret to keeping my body energetic.

I play football almost every week. When running on the field, all those complex code and market analyses temporarily disappear, leaving only simple joy—passing, shooting, scoring.

I also like fitness, running, cycling, swimming, and have even learned martial arts and yoga. Friends say I'm like a "sports collector," wanting to try every sport.

The reason is simple: the body is the foundation of everything. In this era that requires long hours sitting in front of a computer, exercise isn't a luxury—it's a necessity.

## Why Build This Knowledge Base?

The idea for this knowledge base came from a simple discovery: I found myself repeatedly explaining the same concepts to friends—what is DeFi, how to safely store cryptocurrency, how to use AI to improve work efficiency...

Instead of repeating explanations every time, why not systematically organize this knowledge so more people can benefit?

Just like Franklin did in "Poor Richard's Almanack," I hope to share my experiences and thoughts in the four areas of Wealth, Influence, Build, and Health in the simplest and most practical way.

**Wealth**: Not teaching you to get rich quick, but sharing how to rationally understand and participate in this digital economy that's changing the world.

**Influence**: Not teaching you to become an internet celebrity, but sharing how to build personal influence through genuine knowledge sharing.

**Build**: Not empty entrepreneurship theories, but sharing actual product development and business practice experience.

**Health**: Not selling health anxiety, but sharing how to maintain physical and mental health in busy modern life.

## What Do I Hope to Do With You?

I don't want to be a lofty "expert," but hope to be a fellow traveler who enjoys sharing.

If you're curious about cryptocurrency but don't know where to start, I'm willing to share the pitfalls I've stepped in and the lessons I've learned.

If you want to use AI to improve work efficiency but don't know how specifically, I'm willing to share the tools and methods I'm currently using.

If you want to maintain a healthy lifestyle but always lack motivation, I'm willing to share my sports insights and healthy habits.

As Franklin said: "If you want to convince others, appeal to interest, not reason." I hope this knowledge base is useful, practical, and can truly help you improve your life or work.

This is me—Cai Jiawen, an ordinary person on the journey.

Welcome to join my learning and growth journey.
